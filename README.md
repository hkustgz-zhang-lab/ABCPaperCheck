# Research related to ABC
[ABC](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc) is a very popular open source Logic Synthesis project, some research implemented in ABC or related to ABC is recorded here.

This repo also helps people who want to read ABC code properly, research paper is a good start before accessing plain code.

Most of the paper referenced here can be found at Alan Mishchenko's [publication page](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/publications/).

Another [EPFL Isils group](https://github.com/lsils) also has very high quality synthesis research, feel free to add anything interesting to the list.

## General introduction

<br/>This introduction is a bit old but contains history of all Berkeley's tools and how ABC is started, it is written by Prof Robert Brayton.

- [Quick Look under the Hood of ABC](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/programming.pdf)
<br/>A brief but important manual helps understand basic network types and structures in ABC.

If you are working on a parser, read this carefully, I recommend reading the [aiger parser in lorina](https://github.com/hriener/lorina/blob/master/include/lorina/aiger.hpp), which is implemented in regular expression, in ABC, this is done by hard-core char by char shifting.

- For `balance`, check the [original paper](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~jordicf/gavina/BIB/files/tcad03_bidec.pdf) about bi-decomposition.
- Note that in ABC, `balance` command have `-d` and `-s` option but implemented improperly which leads to same result, in mockturtle, the same algorithm skips these two options.

`resub`
- [Scalable Logic Synthesis using a Simple Circuit Structure](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/publications/2006/iwls06_sls.pdf)

<br>The concept of redundancy removal can be found here. The original redundancy removal could still be found in ABC source code but is not registered in the tool, so you can't use it directly, it is marked as absolete.

`dchoice`
<br> *Note: *"The command dchoice uses various methods for rewriting the AIG to minimize the number of AIG nodes while not increasing the number of its levels. In particular, dchoice strives for smaller delay by “balancing”, which decreases the number of AIG levels by decomposing “wide-input” AND gates in a balanced way."* - [Reference](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/publications/2010/fpga10_speedup.pdf)

`speedup`
- [Global Delay Optimization using Structural Choices](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/publications/2009/tech09_speed.pdf)
<br>*Note: ABC LUT library format also has examples in this paper. Since all optimization is on AIG as `strash` is performed after time tracing and critical node marking, so change these two part will help to apply the algorithm after standard cell mapping.

<br> Experiment is performed after `amap` and `&nf -R 1000`.
<br> *Note: `mfs` & `mfs2` are for **LUT-based FPGAs** while `mfs3` is for **standard cells**.
<br> *Gain-based [approach](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~vojin/CLASSES/EPFL/Papers/LE-orig-paper.pdf) deals with delay information.

<br>Espresso, SIS, MVSIS are here.
<br>*Note: Some algorithm in ABC is directly from SIS and MVSIS.

<br>There's also a [paper](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/148012141.pdf) related to the benchmark.
<br>*Note that case `hyp` is quite big and skip it if necessary.

## Other repo
[Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) and [OpenRoad-flow-scripts](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts) are good place to find out discussion about ABC since original ABC repo's issues are not very active.

      SAT solver

  </summary>

This [repo](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/15816-f21/slides/practice.pdf) from CMU can give you a brief introduction on the DIMACS format and how to use SAT solver as an interface.

I was trying to maintain a collection list of SAT solvers, but I have found that [PySAT](https://github.com/pysathq/pysat) seems to contain all the well-known SAT solvers. 

There's a detailed [introduction](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/courses/2007_290N/papers/intro_een_sat03.pdf) on MiniSAT.

## Performance
- Yosys+ABC9 in FPGA is catching up with industry level performance. - [Reference](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/publications/2023/date23_gap.pdf)

## TODO
Some of the implementation was originally been written into the traditional tools such as MVSIS or SIS.
<br>It's better to check if ABC contains the following.
- *“S&S-based and BDD-based resubstitution algorithms were implemented in the resynthesis package used to improve the quality of standard-cell technology mapping in MVSIS”* - [Reference](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/publications/2005/tcad05_s&s.pdf)
